# Minio storage with Canonical Kubernetes

This demo shows how to use Minio storage with Canonical Kubernetes. Minio storage allows you to turn K8s PV into S3 Compatible storage ([https://www.minio.io/kubernetes.html](https://www.minio.io/kubernetes.html)).

It is a pretty useful storage mechanism which gives you Amazon S3 like storage wherever your kubernetes cluster is running. If you're running Kubernetes on-premise within your own data-center, on Google Cloud or Azure, you can avoid the problem of vendor lock-in with AWS by using Minio.

This document assumes you have already deployed Canonical Kubernetes and have a cluster running already.
